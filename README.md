### rust-tutorials

This is a series of exercises found in ['The Book'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) completed to learn the rust language. These were done as a personal challenge to do at least one chapter from each every day until both were completed.
